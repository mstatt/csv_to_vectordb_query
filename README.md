This Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to load a CSV file into Chroma DB, a vector database designed for efficient querying and retrieval. Unlike traditional databases, Chroma DB does not rely on a large language model back-end, making it a powerful tool for vector-based data storage and retrieval.

Chroma DB is particularly useful for applications such as similarity search, recommendation systems, and image recognition, where data is represented as high-dimensional vectors. This guide will walk you through the process of importing your data into Chroma DB for vector-based querying.
